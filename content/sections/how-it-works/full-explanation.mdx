Congress creates a dedicated TPRI facility inside the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. Strategic Economic Zones that meet transparency, labor, and national security benchmarks sign compacts that pre-clear dispute resolution. Investors pay risk-adjusted premiums and receive real-time coverage notifications. When interference occurs, the facility compensates investors within 30 days, then deploys recovery teams leveraging bilateral agreements and attachment authority to reclaim damages from the offending regime or proxy.
