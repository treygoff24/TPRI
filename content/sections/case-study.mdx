title: Case Study — Próspera Proves the Model
summary: Honduras already demonstrates how TPRI-ready zones attract clean investment and community support.
background: default

Próspera on Roatán Island has attracted over **$700 million** in committed investments with 98% private capital. Independent surveys show **61% local approval** thanks to transparent governance and job creation. By guaranteeing long-horizon political stability, TPRI would unlock projects in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and resilient infrastructure that dwarf competing PRC proposals.

- **Jobs today:** 3,000 direct roles with 7,500 indirect across the Bay Islands.
- **Projected with TPRI:** 24,000 jobs within five years and a diversified supply chain hub for the Americas.
- **Counterfactual:** Chinese-led port concessions in the region remain underused and debt-laden. <Citation id="ref-prospera" />
