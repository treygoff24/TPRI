### What it is

Full-value political risk insurance that protects American investors for 25–99 years in allied strategic zones.

### How it works

Congress authorizes a TPRI facility managed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation with explicit recovery power through U.S. courts.

### Why now

China’s state-directed investment is buying influence across the Americas faster than diplomacy can respond. TPRI unleashes private capital at strategic speed. <Citation id="ref-why-now" />

### The innovation

Zone-level umbrella coverage matched with mandatory triple-damages recovery when hostile actors interfere with U.S. investments.

### The safeguards

- 70% minimum U.S. or allied ownership
- OECD-aligned transparency and anti-corruption standards
- Permanent exclusions for adversarial state-owned enterprises
- Host-nation partnership agreements and parliamentary oversight
