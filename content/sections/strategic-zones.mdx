summary: Certified zones partner with the United States to accelerate investment while locking out authoritarian influence.
background: muted

Strategic Economic Zones partner with local governments to deliver transparent, rules-based commerce. They are the antithesis of opaque tax havens—zones must publish fiscal policies, labor safeguards, and environmental protections while granting U.S. investors rock-solid contractual rights.

- **Not tax havens:** aligned with OECD BEPS standards and transparent reporting.
- **Not sovereignty violations:** zones operate by invitation with shared governance boards.
- **Five pillars:** national security vetting, open markets, worker mobility, clean capital, and democratic accountability.
- **Certification:** zones undergo annual compliance reviews and legislative briefings to retain TPRI eligibility.
