TPRI is designed with multiple layers of safeguards to address concerns from across the political spectrum—ensuring taxpayer protection, national security alignment, labor and environmental standards, and congressional oversight.

## Fiscal Protection

**Budget Neutrality Through Recovery**: The mandatory 3× recovery mechanism within three years ensures TPRI is budget-neutral or revenue-positive. Recovery proceeds flow to Treasury's general fund, making expropriation economically irrational while strengthening U.S. fiscal position.

**Private Skin in the Game**: Zone Operators must maintain 5-10% first-loss capital in segregated accounts invested in U.S. obligations, subject to DFC audit. Investors pay premiums—this is insurance, not subsidies.

## National Security Controls

**Permanent Adversary Exclusion**: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are statutorily excluded from TPRI eligibility. Additional countries can be temporarily excluded for national security reasons.

**U.S. Control Requirement**: Zone Operators must be at least 70% owned by United States persons, ensuring American control and alignment with strategic interests.

**Interagency Review**: All Strategic Economic Zone designations undergo National Security Council review, with 30-day congressional notification and potential joint resolution disapproval.

## Labor & Environmental Standards

**Local Workforce Priority**: Strategic Economic Zones must employ majority local nationals with skills transfer as a key performance indicator—ensuring broad-based host-country benefit and political durability.

**OECD Regulatory Reciprocity**: Zones must demonstrate compliance substantially equivalent to OECD standards for labor rights, workplace safety, environmental protection, and responsible development.

**Transparent Governance**: Zone budgets, laws, and regulations must be publicly accessible, preventing corruption and ensuring accountability.

## Congressional Oversight

**Mandatory Reporting**: Annual reports to Congress on claims paid, recoveries pursued, zone performance metrics, and compliance with safeguards.

**Appropriations Control**: Performance-based funding for recovery-executing agencies through regular budget process ensures institutional alignment and accountability.

**Expedited Review**: 30-day congressional notification period with joint resolution authority allows rapid response while maintaining appropriate oversight.

## Sovereignty Protections

**Voluntary Participation**: Host nations choose to accede through formal diplomatic instruments, with options for nationwide or zone-only participation based on their preferences.

**Legal Stability, Not Control**: Zones operate within host nation legal systems while providing enhanced regulatory predictability through enforceable investment agreements.

**Dispute Resolution**: International arbitration provides neutral, efficient resolution—standard in modern investment treaties—rather than imposing U.S. courts on sovereign nations.
