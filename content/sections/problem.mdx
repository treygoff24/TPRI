title: The $137 Billion Problem
summary: China’s state-backed investments in the Americas outpace the United States by more than 4-to-1.
background: muted

China’s strategic financing has locked in port concessions, 5G infrastructure, and mineral rights across Latin America. Without a policy instrument to de-risk allied market democracies, American businesses sit on the sidelines while the People’s Republic of China buys influence outright.

- **$137B** invested by Chinese state-linked firms in Latin America since 2005.
- **$10B** committed to the Chancay megaport alone, creating a Pacific gateway for PRC goods.
- **9 nations** have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in the past two decades.

The cost of delay is compounding geopolitically and economically.
